# Hello World!
Welcome! This is my first ever creation of a site. I have very little experience with coding or creating websites, but I am eager to try and make a successful website. Here is a slight introduction of myself; My name is Matt Schnelle and I was born in Cincinnati, Ohio where I lived until college. I currently am attending Penn State Behrend in Erie, Pennsylvania. During High school I worked various jobs such as at an ice cream parlor, a canoe and kayak rental, a grocery store, and a few others. Starting in 7th grade, I was a member of the swim and water polo team which I continued for 8 years.

# Hypothesis Annotations

My experience of coding is limited to my work done in DIGIT 100. As of now this includes our annotation of course readings. This is where we as a class viewed the same articles and added questions and discussion points to discuss with each other. These are a few examples of my annotations:

# Reflection

Through creating this site on both websites, I found that I am better working with Sites. This application seemed more straightforward than Github. Although, If I were to have extensive prior knowledge of coding, Github would probably be easier to use since it is easier to get around within the application than Sites is. With edited and writing itself, I found Sites to be the simplest application to use. The layout of the actual website I felt was more clear in Sites as well. The link to the other version of my website can be found [here.](sites.psu.edu/mysite6176/)
