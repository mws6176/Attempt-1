# Hello World!
Welcome! This is my first ever creation of a site. I have very little experience with coding or creating websites, but I am eager to try and make a successful website. Here is a slight introduction of myself; My name is Matt Schnelle and I was born in Cincinnati, Ohio where I lived until college. I currently am attending Penn State Behrend in Erie, Pennsylvania. During High school I worked various jobs such as at an ice cream parlor, a canoe and kayak rental, a grocery store, and a few others. Starting in 7th grade, I was a member of the swim and water polo team which I continued for 8 years.
